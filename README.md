###The Big Nerd Ranch Guide  
####Review/ Material by Morgan Murrah


`11/3/2016- Preface`

This repo is from working through the Front-End Web Development Guide by the Big Nerd Ranch. I intend to add some commentary as I go along. From the contents page a lot of the material touches similar areas and accomplishes similar things covered in the [Atlanta WDI Curriculum](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum).
However, from a glance I observe that the BNR book uses slightly different methods and approaches for similar objectives. I believe I will get a lot out of it/it will re-enforce what I know.

I am particularly looking forward to working towards the end of the book and approaching the EmberJS framework which I have sparse experience with.

`Chapter 1-2: Getting started`
--
I have completed Chapters 1 and 2 with relative ease and quickly. I have gained some benefit from becoming familiar with Atom as I have previously only used Sublime Text. 

As embarassing as it is to admit after 12 weeks of intensive full time development... I only now have learned once and for all the proper way to add a favicon to a web page. Feels good to banish that missing favicon error forever.

Learning to use Browsersync has also been a bonus, I definitely think I will be incorporating this in future development.

`Chapter 3: Styles`

*Atomized styling.* was another seemingly simple but important turn of approach. Heretofore I have approached problems as a process of scaffolding a framework first - like setting our rows or columns or major shapes - and then placing the specific objects within the scaffold.

From my very brief introduction to atomized styling I can see how from a process of development starting from the more specific, interesting elements and then building them up into a scaffold could make a difference. It seems much more fluid and adaptable.

This chapter was also a reminder to choose HTML tags based on what they are i.e. unordered list elements for an actually unorded list - and not something else dependent how the browser will style them by default- something that might be easy to forget when you mentally feel you have 'moved past basic HTML'. 

HSLA values for color which are not always supported are a thing I had forgot existed. 

`Chapter 4: Flexbox`
--
Learning [Flexbox in WDI 7](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum/css-flexbox) supplemented with games such as [Flexbox froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) turned out to be very memorable. This was because I went home and shared the fact I learned about flexbox to some friends and was surprised as some very senior/experienced IT people I knew were interested as this Flexbox approach was just as new to them as it was for me. 

This chapter in the BNR book much like the WDI class is invaluable and accurately represents the state of the 'art' of CSS - as in, it puts a lot of hacky, undesirable practices such as floats and others largely behind us.

**Highlights/gaps in my knowledge:**

* Overflow-x - A simple and useful scrolling property I had overlooked.
* The [flex shorthand property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex). Used flexbox a fair bit but under-used this sh property.
* Absolute positioning. A well known "Gotcha" and sometimes interview question:

> **An absolute position must have:**

>* a property position: absolute (fair enough...)
* coordinates such as top/right/bottom/left, pixels or relatives lengths (ok..)
* **an ancestor element with an explicitly declared position property with a value of relative or absolute - if no ancestor has a declared position property, the absolutley defined positioned element with be placed relevative to the <html> element (Yikes!)**

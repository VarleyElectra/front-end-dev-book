# front-end-dev-book

`11/3/2016`

This repo is from working through the Front-End Web Development Guide by the Big Nerd Ranch. I received this as a freebie at an ATL Javascript Meetup and very grateful.

I intend to add some commentary as I go along. From the contents page a lot of the material touches similar areas and accomplishes similar things covered in the [Atlanta WDI Curriculum](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum).
However, I observe that the BNR book uses slightly different methods and approaches, so I believe I will get a lot out of it/it will re-enforce what I know. Will see!

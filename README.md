# Front-End Web Development 

##The Big Nerd Ranch Guide  
####Review/ Material by Morgan Murrah


`11/3/2016`

This repo is from working through the Front-End Web Development Guide by the Big Nerd Ranch. I received this as a freebie at an ATL Javascript Meetup and I am very grateful for it.

I intend to add some commentary as I go along. From the contents page a lot of the material touches similar areas and accomplishes similar things covered in the [Atlanta WDI Curriculum](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum).
However, from a glance I observe that the BNR book uses slightly different methods and approaches for similar objectives. I believe I will get a lot out of it/it will re-enforce what I know.

I am particularly looking forward to working towards the end of the book and approaching the EmberJS framework which I have sparse experience with.

I have completed Chapters 1 and 2 with relative ease - I have gained some benefit from becoming familiar with Atom and also... as embarassing as it is to admit... learning once and for all the proper way to add a favicon to a web page. Despite doing 12 weeks of intensive web dev 'stuff' I never learned that little one. This is at least one error I can say I have banished.

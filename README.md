# Front-End Web Development 

##The Big Nerd Ranch Guide  
####Review/ Material by Morgan Murrah


`11/3/2016- Preface`

This repo is from working through the Front-End Web Development Guide by the Big Nerd Ranch. I received this as a freebie at an ATL Javascript Meetup and I am very grateful for it.

I intend to add some commentary as I go along. From the contents page a lot of the material touches similar areas and accomplishes similar things covered in the [Atlanta WDI Curriculum](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum).
However, from a glance I observe that the BNR book uses slightly different methods and approaches for similar objectives. I believe I will get a lot out of it/it will re-enforce what I know.

I am particularly looking forward to working towards the end of the book and approaching the EmberJS framework which I have sparse experience with.

`Chapter 1-2: Getting started`

I have completed Chapters 1 and 2 with relative ease and quickly. I have gained some benefit from becoming familiar with Atom as I have previously only used Sublime Text. 

As embarassing as it is to admit after 12 weeks of intensive full time development... I only now have learned once and for all the proper way to add a favicon to a web page. Feels good to banish that missing favicon error forever.

Learning to use Browsersync has also been a bonus, I definitely think I will be incorporating this in future development.

`Chapter 3: Styles`

*Atomized styling.* was another seemingly simple but important turn of approach. Heretofore I have approached problems as a process of scaffolding a framework first - like setting our rows or columns or major shapes - and then placing the specific objects within the scaffold.

From my very brief introduction to atomized styling I can see how from a process of development starting from the more specific, interesting elements and then building them up into a scaffold could make a difference. It seems much more fluid and adaptable.

This chapter was also a reminder to choose HTML tags based on what they are i.e. unordered list elements for an actually unorded list - and not something else dependent how the browser will style them by default- something that might be easy to forget when you mentally feel you have 'moved past basic HTML'. 

HSLA values for color which are not always supported are a thing I had forgot existed. 

`Chapter 4: Flexbox`

One of my favorites to come...
